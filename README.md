<h2 align="center">Explorer | Freelancer | Udemy Instructor</h2>

After seven years immersed in the world of New Age technology, my favorite thing is undoubtedly my keyboard. In this journey, I've honed my coding skills, treating my code as a skill and my keyboard as a weapon in the battlefield of technology. From childhood dreams of being a hacker to mastering Python, JavaScript, C, and C++, my passion for learning everything about computers has become my driving force. I firmly believe that dedicating oneself to pure learning with a clear mind eventually results in a self-made uniqueness shaping one's own reality.
